## File issues
The best way to get started with a contribution is to start a dialog with us. Sometimes features will be under development or out of scope for this library and it's best to check before starting work on contribution, especially for large work items.

## Pull requests
All pull requests should be submitted against the **dev** branch or a specific feature branch. 

Some things to note about this project:

### How the library is built
The .Net client library has a handwritten set of core files and two folders of generated models and request builders. These models and request builders are generated using the [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota). **Changes made to the generated folders will be overwritten** the next time the generator is run.

### How the generator works
You can view the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md) for a full run-through of its capabilities.

The generator runs through an OpenAPI-compliant metadata file maintained by Microsoft Graph (https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/blob/master/openapi/v1.0/openapi.yaml).

### When new features are added to the library
Generation happens as part of a manual process that occurs once a significant change or set of changes has been added to the Graph. This may include:
 - A new workload comes to v1.0 of Graph (Microsoft Teams, Batching, etc.)
 - There is significant addition of functionality (Delta Queries, etc.)
 
However, this is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the library is missing v1.0 Graph functionality that you wish to utilize, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-typescript/issues).

We do our best to prevent breaking changes from being introduced into the library during this process. If you find a breaking change, please file an issue and we will work to get this resolved ASAP.
