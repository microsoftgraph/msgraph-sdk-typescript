/**
 * Retrieve a list of educationOutcome objects. There are four types of outcomes: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, **educationRubricOutcome**, and **educationFeedbackResourceOutcome**. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation. A submission for a credit assignment (one that has no point value and no rubric) will have an educationFeedbackOutcome. (It might also return an educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A submission for a points assignment (one that has a point value assigned) will have both an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationPointsOutcome. A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric (no points), will have an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationRubricOutcome. (It might also return an educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a points rubric, will have an educationFeedbackOutcome, an educationPointsOutcome, and an educationRubricOutcome. A submission for a feedback resource will have an educationFeedbackResourceOutcome. All outcome types have a regular and a published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**. The regular property is the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the most recent value returned to the student.
